### Hi there

I'm Bernard Xiong, the founder of RT-Thread. I created the RT-Thread embedded operating system in 2006, and have been promoting its evolution for more than ten years (From RT-Thread Kernel to shell, file system, PersimUI, RT-Thread Smart etc). And always integrate my thoughts on the application scenarios: what kind of operating system does the world need.

Looking forward to communicating with you. 👋
